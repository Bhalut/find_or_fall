# Find or Fall

'Find or Fall' is a casual, online, turn-based video game for Android devices, where two persons must guess which is the button that makes their opponent fall, they have a the same board with eight buttons so it's possible to make yourself fall, the game ends when someone falls.

Our purpose with this game is to make people laugh, through that special feeling of beating someone in a game of luck, like rock-paper-scissors.
